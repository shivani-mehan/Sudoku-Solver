# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku solver written with VBA and SQL that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles of any difficulty level. It identifies the difficulty level of the solved puzzle and calculates, as well as keeps track of, the time it took to finish each puzzle. 


A Microsoft Access database is continuously updated with the tracked time and corresponding difficulty level of each solved puzzle, which then reads back into the application in the form of charts and statistics.
